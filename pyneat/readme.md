# Over-commented package of NEAT implementation

This package is deliberately over-commented for easy understanding of NEAT (neuro evolution of augmenting topologies).

### How to read this code
Use the following order while reading this code for NEAT.

1. `node.py`: explains the functionality of node (neuron) in genome (network)

2. `edge.py`: explains the functionality of edge (connection between two neurons) in each genome (network)

3. `genome.py`: explains the functionality of each genome (neural network) in NEAT
